For Chefs Authentication System

What we have already:
- Chef model and validations
- Chefs table with columns chefname and email

What we need to do:
Authentication we will use (Has secure password)
- Add passwords to the chefstable so the chefs can be authenticated and logged in
- Use email as login credentials, since email is unique
- Ability to register new chefs to use the app
- Ability to display a chefs profile
- Ability to list all chefs using the app
- Ability for all chefs to login and logout of the app
- Restrict actions, ie edit recipe and like feature to logged in chefs only
- Restricting edit of recipes by chefs who created the recipes

Authentication Updates

1) Show recipe page -> Ability to edit/update only own recipe
2) Navigation partial -> Toggle menu, restrict new
3) Restrict thumbs up/down action to only logged in users
4)Recipe - update to current_user
5) Like - update to current_user
6) Before_action :require_user, except [:show, :index]
7) Before_action :require_same_user for chefs, only: [:edit, :update]
